* Busiest travel times.
* Durations of trips.
* Types of user by gender, age, etc.

### Files Used
Data files for each city in CSV format, e.g. './chicago.csv'. See 'Sources' below.

### How to Use
*Prerequisite:*
_Install the latest stable version of Python, along with the Pandas and NumPy libraries._

1. Clone/fork the project.
2. Add the source data (below) to the project root.
3. Execute the bikeshare_2.py file in a terminal. E.g. `python bikeshare_2.py`
